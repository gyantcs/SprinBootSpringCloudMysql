Spring Boot Mysql app to demonstrate 3 different ways of configuration on Pivotal Cloud Foundry

== 1. Let Java Buildpack Autoreconfiguration handle it. See cf-db-services-sample-auto folder
The simplest approach is to do nothing and let Cloud Foundry's Java Buildpack handle the details.
Cloud Foundry's Java Buildpack injects a library called the https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack-auto-reconfiguration[Java Buildpack Auto Reconfiguration] into the runtime deployable
which reconfigures the service connectivity appropriately.

Check the Manifest file called 'manifest.yml' under the folder **-auto. It has the service that this App will bind to that is picked up by the Spring Auto connector with this line. 

  
      - mydb
```diff
+  services:
- - mydb
```
###### Note: You will create a service on your PCF Org with Name "mydb" that will be of type Mysql.

== 2. Use Java Environment properties. See cf-db-services-sample-props folder
Spring Boot exposes the VCAP_SERVICES properties which is in the form of a JSON into a more consumable format - as simple environment properties. These properties can be used for configuring
the connectivity to the service

== 3. Use Spring Cloud Connector. See  cf-db-services-sample-connector folder. 
http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-connectors/[Spring Cloud Connector] provides the most advanced configuration for enabling connectivity to an external service.

Any of the versions of the application can be brought up by the following steps:

=== Installing and deploying a MYSql on Mac OSX
[source]
----
brew install mysql
mysql.server start
mysql -u root

CREATE USER 'springpong'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'springpong';
CREATE DATABASE pong_matcher_spring_development;
GRANT ALL ON pong_matcher_spring_development.* TO 'springpong'@'localhost';
----

=== Start the application
[source]
----
mvn spring-boot:run
----

=== Check if the application has started up
Try the endpoint available here - http://localhost:8080/courses
